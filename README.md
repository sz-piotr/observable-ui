# Observable UI - Proof of Concept 

This is a proof of concept repository containg an implementation of a web app using only rxjs. It implements a redux-like pattern for state management and recreates the entire dom every time something changes.

The entire code (app + runtime) takes up less than 60 lines of code.

You can play around with it here: [observable-ui.netlify.com](observable-ui.netlify.com)
